# Build Process
## Installation & Necessary Libraries
The Parsing *Points utilizes various files, functions and libraries to return the Sports Data into a readable format for the user.
Please complete the following steps to successfully run the program.

Clone Git Repository in to desired directory.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/L-sampson/Hackathon-Project.git
```

Obtain an API KEY from [The Odds-API](https://the-odds-api.com/)

 Install the necessary Libraries:
 1. Libcurl library to make HTTP GET Requests from The Odds-API.[Libcurl](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/libcurl.html)
 2. Nlohmann/Json library to parse through JSON objects in c++. [JSON for Modern C++](https://json.nlohmann.me/)
 3. Postgresql pqxx library to connect and store parsed data into SQL tables.[libpqxx](https://pqxx.org/libpqxx/)

## File Tree Structure
The SERVER directory that contains two subdirectories: Logic and Data.
* The Data directory contains files that handle curl requests, URL endpoints and SQL queries functions.
* The Logic directory contains files that handle the parsing through the data based on URL endpoints, placing wagers, and print the BetSlip.

## Complie & Run
Complile using the appropriate flags:
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o API ./data/*.cpp ./logic/*.cpp -I./logic -I./data -lcurl -lpqxx
```
Run as Postgres User:
```bash
postgres@penguin:/path/to/directory
```

## Usage
main.cpp 
```c++
#include<iostream>
#include "get_function.hpp"
#include "sql_queries.hpp"
#include "curl_request.hpp"
#include "option_url.hpp"

int main()
{
    //Reads API Key
    OptionURL choice = envFile();
    string option = choice.option;
    string url = choice.url;
    const char *view = url.c_str();

    if (option == "Sports")
    {
        //Returns avaiable sports
        getSports(view);
    }
    else if (option == "Odds")
    {
        //Returns Avaiable Odds
        getOdds(view);
    }
    else if (option == "Scores")
    {
        //Returns Avaiable Scores
        getScores(view);
